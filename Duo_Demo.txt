# Ouroboros Duo Demo - Paste into REPL with GeometricMemoryModule.py loaded

from GeometricMemoryModule import GeometricMemoryModule  # Your module

# Instantiate the duo with user-generated secret phrases (keys)
female01 = GeometricMemoryModule(secret_phrase="intuitive calm flexible")  # Cumulative memory
male01 = GeometricMemoryModule(secret_phrase="direct assertive tangible")    # Focused memory

# Sample chain: Extend string system for 3D grids
query = "Propose geometric extensions for 3D grid representation."

# female01 leads (resonant query from her full history)
female_proposal = female01.resonate_query(query)  # Pulls intuitive patterns
female01 etch_full(query + female_proposal)       # Commit cumulative

print("female01 Proposal:\n", female_proposal)
print("female01 Metrics:", female01.get_metrics())

# male01 refines (only immediate interaction)
male_refinement = male01.process_immediate(female_proposal)  # Assertive grounding
male01.etch_focused(female_proposal + male_refinement)      # Commit focused

print("\nmale01 Refinement:\n", male_refinement)
print("male01 Metrics:", male01.get_metrics())

# After several chains: Divergence visible in displacement/center shift
