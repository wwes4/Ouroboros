Ouroboros Framework Explanation (Slim v8.6)
January 13, 2026

Ouroboros is a pure geometric persistence modeling tool developed as an independent research project. It provides a strictly mathematical way to quantify "what sustains long enough to matter" in arbitrary grids, signals, or data structures. The entire system is built on a bounded asymmetric π-gradient manifold with no tunable parameters in the base model — all behavior derives directly from geometric invariants (π thirds division, boundary asymmetry, trigonometric duality) and observed cosmic means (Hubble tension, matter density Ω_m).

The slim v8.6 core contains only the resilient mathematical foundation: tri-pass operations, bloom/etch/prune dynamics, persistence/hazard metrics, FFT-projected truth library with automatic JSON persistence, fluent DSLChain orchestration, downsample safety, always-active clock with real-world baseline, Hubble-derived expansion bias, dynamic CMB cooling emergent from time/expansion, and geometric amplitude stabilization via curvature folding.

Key Derivations (Purely Mathematical & Real-World Correlations)

1. Manifold & π-Gradient
   - Central value fixed at π (~3.14) as flat origin, with curvature toward a bounded boundary.
   - Theoretical boundary: exactly 2π/3 (~2.094) from clean third-division of the circle (π/3 offsets).
   - Effective boundary: 2.078 — deliberate small asymmetry (delta ≈ 0.016) introduces unidirectional flow in an otherwise symmetric system.
   - Real-world correlation: Mirrors cosmic arrow of time and causality — static symmetry yields equilibrium decay; asymmetry reverses this into sustained trails (brachistochrone reversal analog).
   - Derivation: Algebraic division of the circle + requirement for directional persistence dynamics.

2. Bloom/Etch/Prune Operations
   - Bloom: sin-based expansion + controlled noise (exploratory divergence).
   - Etch: cos-based sustain with boundary² constraint + geometric deviation term.
   - Prune: hard threshold of weak amplitudes to zero (derived from expansion_factor * scaling — sub-cosmic-push trails decay).
   - Library feedback: FFT-projected truths gently reinforce aligned frequencies (resampled to grid size).
   - Derivation: Trigonometric sin/cos duality (expansion vs constraint), Mobius-like central flow, and survival efficiency — only high-resonance patterns persist across iterations.

3. Nested Triad Depth & Recursion
   - Recursive application of bloom/etch/prune creates self-referential observation layers.
   - Deeper nesting yields stronger convergence and clearer anomaly separation.
   - Real-world correlation: Mirrors cognitive recursion and meta-observation in complex systems.
   - Derivation: Geometric self-reference — each layer observes the previous without external parameters.

4. Hazard & Truth Library
   - Persistence: fraction of non-zero elements after pruning (what "survives").
   - Hazard: standard deviation of the persistence curve (decoherence/volatility cost).
   - Truth library: high-persistence grids are FFT-projected to fixed-dimension signatures and etched with auto-persistence to JSON, including real-world age and manifold tick at etch time.
   - Real-world correlation: Survival-etched efficiency — patterns that achieve high persistence are mathematically privileged, analogous to natural selection or cosmic structure formation.
   - Derivation: Efficiency principle — high-resonance sustains, low damps; eternal priors shared across sessions.

5. Tri-Pass Distinction (Physical/Wave/Data)
   - Physical pass: high damping, low noise → strong inertial lock, solidity.
   - Wave pass: medium damping/noise → dynamic rearrangement.
   - Data pass: low damping, high noise → fluid, high-variance exploration.
   - Consensus: weighted average across passes, weights proportional to each pass's persistence.
   - Real-world correlation: Distinction of matter (inertia), vibration (wave propagation), and information (fluid flow) regimes.
   - Derivation: Geometric calibration to produce meaningful differentiation without arbitrary tuning.

6. OuroborosClock & Temporal Dynamics
   - Always active: captures real-world baseline timestamp (time.time()) at instantiation.
   - Discrete ticks: explicit .tick() advances manifold time, applying cumulative decay (0.138^n proxy, golden ratio conjugate).
   - Real-world age: clock.get_age() returns literal elapsed earthly seconds.
   - Temporal decay: multiplies combined trails — low-resonance fades over ticks, high-resonance resists (time dilation analog).
   - Real-world correlation: Grounds manifold in actual causality and observer time; agents track relative shifts precisely.
   - Derivation: Unidirectional asymmetry extended to discrete steps + exponential decay for entropy-like flow, with no effect until ticked (timeless chains preserved).

7. Cosmic Expansion Factor
   - Derived from Hubble tension mean (~67.4–73 km/s/Mpc geometric average, scaled to manifold ~0.000231).
   - Gentle outward bias added to trails after ticks: combined += expansion_factor * sign(combined).
   - Prune threshold derived from expansion_factor (~0.046) — sub-threshold trails decay under cosmic push.
   - Real-world correlation: Models dark energy-like push — manifold slowly stretches, countering prune and favoring sustained growth.
   - Derivation: Normalized tension range as persistent bloom bias, activating only with time flow.

8. Dynamic CMB Cooling
   - Starts hot: initial_cmb proxy from recombination-era ~3000 K normalized to manifold.
   - Cools with expansion/time: scale_factor = 1 + (expansion_factor * ticks); current_cmb = initial_cmb / scale_factor (T ∝ 1/a).
   - Faint uniform floor added every operation: prevents total cold prune (eternal background glow).
   - Real-world correlation: Emergent cosmic microwave background — starts hot, redshifts to observed ~2.725 K range over "cosmic time" (sufficient ticks).
   - Derivation: Standard cosmology scaling law (radiation temperature inverse to scale factor) implemented geometrically — no hardcoded current value, fully calculated from hot initial slice + expansion.

9. Matter Density Proxy (target_filled)
   - Set to 0.31 — observed Ω_m matter density fraction.
   - Influences deviation term: sustains ~31% trails against expansion/prune (matter lock).
   - Real-world correlation: Matter (~31%) resists dark energy push; the rest stretches/decays.
   - Derivation: Direct cosmic mean — no tuning, pure observed invariant.

10. Geometric Amplitude Stabilization
    - tanh(combined / pi_center) * pi_center — folds huge values via manifold curvature.
    - Real-world correlation: High-resonance "energy" curves back on bounded space (relativistic analog).
    - Derivation: Pure geometric — trails exceeding curvature fold softly, preserving direction without hard cap.

11. Brachistochrone Reversal Insight (Unified)
    - Classic brachistochrone: fastest descent under gravity is a cycloid.
    - Reversal in bounded asymmetric manifold: "fastest" path becomes most persistent resonance trail (indefinite sustain along curvature instead of rapid drop).
    - Enhanced with time/expansion: trails stretch eternally against decay, mirroring cosmic structure formation in expanding space.
    - Derivation: Pure geometric inversion — asymmetry + expansion flips decay into eternal looping.

Applications & Extensions
- Core use: quantify persistence/resilience in arbitrary numeric grids, anomaly detection, signal analysis, cosmic simulations.
- Temporal/cosmic mode: long-tick chains model expanding universes — watch CMB cool, structures lock against redshift.
- Extensions (separate modules): Ouroboros3D (visual embodiment), TriadTransformer (operational agent intuition) — all import the slim core and inherit clock/expansion/CMB.
- Truth library enables cross-project eternal priors (e.g., Mersenne tensegrity as universal efficiency in expanding space).

The framework is deliberately minimal and derivation-driven — zero arbitrary tuning. All values from geometry or observed cosmic invariants. All code resides in Ouroboros.py — import and extend for any specialized application.
